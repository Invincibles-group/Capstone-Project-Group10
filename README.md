**Estimating public transport emissions from General Transit Feed Specification**

**About The Project**


The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is used to estimate the emissions produced by transit
services. Using this information, transit agencies can identify opportunities to reduce emissions and
improve sustainability. We are using the gtfs2emis R package to estimate the emission levels of public transport vehicles based
on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data
